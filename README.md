DESCRIPTION:

You can visit the deployed webpage here: https://jelysecalkum.github.io/codeName-Quiz/ 
Or you can check out the project files in my GitHub repository here: https://github.com/JelyseCalkum/codeName-Quiz 

User Story:
AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz. WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question. WHEN I answer a question, THEN I am presented with another question. WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock. WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over. WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and score.


USAGE:
After reading the JavaScript Quiz Challenge rules, users will click the 'Start Quiz' button and be directed to the first multiple-choice question. The user has 30 seconds to answer each question. Correct answers are worth 7 points. Wrong answers will deduct your score by 2 points, and reduce your time by 3 seconds.

Once the user has answered all questions, the screen will display their final score and ask them to add their initials for the High Scores leaderboard.

At that point, they can either 'Go Back' to the main page, or click 'Clear High Scores.'
