APPLICATION OVERVIEW:

User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

After reading the JavaScript Quiz Challenge rules, users will click the 'Start Quiz' button and be directed to the first multiple-choice question. Once they have answered all questions, the screen will display their final score and ask them to add their initials for the High Scores leaderboard. At that point, they can either 'Go Back' to the main page, or click 'Clear High Scores.'
